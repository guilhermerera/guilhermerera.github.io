# üìñ What I learned
How to use ReactJS to create a page that can be completely dinamic, thinking OOP, using grid, flex box and responsiveness best practices. This was probably my biggest challange and lesson in this project, it was my first time trying it from scratch and alone. I learned how to properly organize my CSS in more than one file, separating what was meant to be structure and whats styling, so I could easily change the dark/light theme, while building those CSS files with SASS.

```html/css/js
I know there's a lot to improve on my code, but I'm pretty proud about the result and how it came out in this project, especialy beacuse this is my first time with ReactJS and SASS.
