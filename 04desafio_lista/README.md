# To-do Easy List
Project created for the ProgramadorBR's WebDev FullStack course.

The project's proposal was to create a simple task list, with a task input field. The list should be saved for later consultation, after refreshing the page or when closing and returning.
The main focus of the project is JS, so I made the CSS as simple as possible, mobile driven, because I wanted to give this project an app feeling.

Created with HTML, CSS and JS.
